I was going to keep quiet about the european union referendum because I wasn't firmly
in either camp but it's too large an issue to sit on the fence on and after careful
consideration **I'm declaring for the out-camp**.

I was *originally an undeclared part of the in-camp*. The EU, as a block, is our closest
partner in pretty much all senses and it's very much better to be in and influence than
be out. As other countries know to their detriment if you with to work and trade with the
EU you have to accept a number of their policies anyway.

However I severely dislike the European Commission, Council, Parliament, Council of Europe etc.
I see them as very different from the way the British originally perceived the EEC (European Economic Community),
which was that of a tariff-free trade area with free movement of people, goods and services - which is a good thing.
The EEC is now an unelected technocratic EU which is legislating in all possible areas, invading the
sovereign rights of constituent countries, creating pointless red-tape and's pretty much stated aim is to create a
supranational federal republic.

Cameron was an idiot. He was never going significantly change the EU or our relationship
with it. The EU has gone far to far and is such a vast self-serving beast a softly-softly approach
is not going to fix it. He was always going to fail and then be on the back foot at
the referendum. In order to establish a fundamental change the EU needs to be destroyed and rebuilt as something far simpler.
Economically and politically this is going to hurt everyone but it's something that needs to happen. I originally wanted
to pass the buck on this one, stick with the status quo and avoid the hurt but you cannot
continue to be successful if you're going to avoid the big decisions.

The fallout will be huge. They'll probably be a recession. Germany will be upset, maybe even disappointed. France will be petty. Greece will fail. The others will bemused. Hopefully we start a wave of splitters from either the whole thing, or certain institutions and eventually the
whole apparatus will topple. The timing isn't great. With an aggressive Russia and continued rise in "anti western"
terrorism delaying we should stick together and potentially delay the tough decision. We still have NATO
(trust Trump doesn't get in), which is the best vehicle for tackling Russia and the UN for tackling middle eastern unrest.

For me the fundamental issue is the institutions of the European Union; not it's counties or it's peoples. We need to remember this.
For a lot of people they see the two as the same. **EU != Europe.** The EU is just an overreaching institution that needs to be dismantled. Our relationships with our closest neighbours *could* and *should* remain fairly unchanged.

That's the inward view (for the internal market), what about the external market? Over the next 50 years economic growth is going to
come from outside the EU, no inside it. The beast can continue expanding east to Turkey etc. but it will not match South America, Africa and Asia.
We need to be released from EU red tape to exploit these opportunities for ourselves. We need to build on the Commonwealth network and nurture our international relationships. Yes, we're smaller than a combined EU but as the 5th largest economy in the world we have serious clout and power.
We need to leverage this to move faster, avoid EU bureaucracy and make our own trade deals.

There are other facts and figures, geopolitical and economic arguments (most supporting remain) but I don't think they really matter.
I want to continue to work, be friends and trade with our closest european partners and remain "in Europe". However we
need to "leave the EU" and if we can destroy it.
