<div class="alert alert-info">I am available for work full-time from 3rd April. I am also available from the 6th-17th March.</div>

I am looking for javascript opportunities. I am a full-stack developer currently focussing on node.js/Express based backend apps and React based frontend apps.

I have been working professionally as a software engineer for over 10 years (since 2006). Over the years I have worked with 100s of different technologies, languages and platforms and am a generalist with specialism in javascript. I have a wide knowledge of all things web and some things not. I am a massive geek but skilled at understanding business requirements and communicating with non-technical folk.

See my [Stack Overflow CV](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/msyea). Contact me on myfirstname@msyea.co.uk (hint. my first name is Simon).

Random accomplishments/projects that aren't a dump of keywords:

* The first decent web app I wrote in 2004 was a theatre booking app that had a flash frontend, which allowed users to select their seat from available seats on an auditorium floorplan. The backend was PHP+MySQL.
* Building robots using with arduino and raspberry pi when they first came to market. Building a controller node.js server and webapp to control them. Studying computer vision.
* Taking a half-baked implementation of the Internet Printing Protocol and building a node.js app that could pretend to be a printer.
* Taking a half-baked implementation of the WebDAV protocol and doing creative things with it - node.js.
* Experimenting with 2 way SMS applications - node.js.
* Streaming data from satellite transmitters and turning them into Strava tracks - node.js.
* Building an offline HTML5 mobile app very early on after being blown away by the [FT App](https://app.ft.com).
