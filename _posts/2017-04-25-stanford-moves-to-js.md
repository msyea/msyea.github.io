I came across [this](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/24/stanford_tests_javascript_in_place_of_java/) article
on [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk) this morning whilst perusing the tech press over a coffee.

The crux of it is that Stanford University has moved away from Java to Javascript for
it's introductory computer science course. This pretty interesting.

CompSci courses tending to be years in the making and behind the curve on what is trending in software. Does this
mean that Javascript is now fully established and not just a *web darling* anymore?

I'm not totally convinced that moving to Javascript is a good idea. Javascript is a pretty unique language in
many respects. Instead of the "normal" "classical" object class inheritance it uses a prototype inheritance chain.
Most variables are objects and it's dynamically typed. If teaching CompSci, it probably most beneficial to
stick with a more "traditional" language that has all these "strict" constructs in. I find it best
to learn in a more traditional environment and then move away from this rather
than learning in a loose-and-fast environment and then trying to move back to a more formal environment.

However on balance, javascript is very popular and has matured significantly that people are now writing much higher
quality code than they once were. If they use node.js and encourage their students to write complicated embedded/networking apps that
target environments other that http(s) and the web it could be a good decision. Javascript runs everywhere and has a huge commercial
application. More and more I see it being accepted in traditionally strict and slow moving environments.

I never actually studied CompSci but my path went as this: Procedural PHP -> Object oriented PHP -> Simple Javascript -> Complex Javascript
(with dabbling in Ruby, Python and Java).
Although PHP 5.2, from a CompSci point of view, wasn't a very developed language it gave me a good basis in classical inheritance, which allowed me
to "move on" and construct more complex applications. I think skipping this step out would have really held me back. Although I no longer use classical
inheritance in my Javascript projects a solid understanding of it has hugely benefitted my overall experience and allows me to architect more complex applications.
