title: Quick Rave About CircleCI

I've just deployed [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for a [VetCraft](http://vetcraft.eu),
a client of mine. [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) is always impresses me. It follows our [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and when
we commit to the development branch, it checks out the code, downloads our dependencies (
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/)) runs our build script
([Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for [Laravel](https://laravel.com)) and runs our tests ([PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)).
If all is successful it gzips the results and scps it to our development server, brings the server down, runs database
migrations, a few more tests and then brings the server back up.

This is all automatically done from a commit/merge to our development branch. Takes me 1 second, CircleCI about 3 minutes, allows
us to work faster and saves me hours per week.

:heart: CircleCI.
